# RMSdistance.c
RMS distance of two input files

Program that calculates the RMS value from two
frequency input files and then prints 
out the RMS distance for each file.

RMS distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square

Basically, the program receives 2 input files and tries to see how different
they are based off of the text input. If the frequencies are close or similar
then they are most likely written in a similar style/written by a similar author.
